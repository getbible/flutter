# Architecture

## Decision record ADR-001

The app uses a layered, local-first architecture. Flutter widgets depend on application state, application state depends on repository contracts, and data adapters implement those contracts. This makes the persistence and future synchronization boundaries explicit without claiming a synchronization backend exists.

Provider/`ChangeNotifier` currently supplies the small application state surface. GoRouter is pinned for the planned canonical deep-link graph. If state complexity grows, migration to Riverpod should be one deliberate ADR rather than mixing state systems feature by feature.

SQLite is the system of record. Drift supplies cross-platform executors and background native database creation. Models perform strict, versioned serialization rather than accepting loose maps throughout the application.

## Runtime flow

1. `main.dart` initializes Flutter and opens the database.
2. `AppState` loads preferences and last reading position.
3. `CachedBibleRepository` gets translation/book/chapter data.
4. The repository checks cached records, expiry, and API hashes.
5. `ReaderScreen` renders typed chapter data and reports cache freshness.
6. Annotation/settings repositories persist user actions immediately.

## Extension points

- Add use-case classes when `AppState` would otherwise accumulate business rules.
- Implement new repository adapters for optional future synchronization; retain SQLite as offline source of truth.
- Keep platform share/file-picker integration behind services.
- Add deep-link routes without exposing API numeric details to widgets.

## Security and privacy boundaries

No secrets are required. Imported JSON is hostile input and must be size-bounded, decoded, fully validated, merged in memory, then committed transactionally. URLs are constructed from validated translation identifiers and positive numeric passage fields.
